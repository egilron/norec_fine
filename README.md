# NoReC_fine

This dataset is described in the paper _A Fine-grained Sentiment Dataset for Norwegian_ by P. Mæhlum, J. Barnes, L. Øvrelid and E. Velldal, currently pending review for LREC 2020.

## Overview 
While the previously released dataset NoReC_eval labeled sentences as to whether they are _evaluative_ or sentiment-bearing, NoReC_fine expands on these annotations by also labeling polar expressions, holders and targets. The data comprises roughly 8000 sentences across almost 300 reviews and 10 different thematic categories (literature, products, restaurants, etc.), and is a subset of the [Norwegian Review Corpus](https://github.com/ltgoslo/norec) (NoReC; [Velldal et al. 2018](http://www.lrec-conf.org/proceedings/lrec2018/pdf/851.pdf)).
